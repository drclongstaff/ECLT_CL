# ECLT_CL
Clot lysis for ECLT curves using Shinylive
First attempt to make a shiny app using shinylive.
Uses a simple clot lysis code (nearest point for 50% lysis with no interpolation).
Adds a capability to remove some data from noisy wells, which are more likely for Euglobulin Clot Lysis Time (ECLT) curves
